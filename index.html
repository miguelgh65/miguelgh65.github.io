        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I currently work on an international project for ST Engineering Idirect in the role of Application Engineer. My responsibilities revolve around support for satellite networks, spanning from the installation of hubs on the Dialog platform to Python scripting development. My true passion lies in data science and data analytics, leading me to adopt roles focused on these areas. I've developed algorithms to enhance team efficiency, conducted analytics using Salesforce API, and ventured into artificial intelligence, specifically linear regression algorithms like Lasso and Ridge, and deep learning for time series prediction.
