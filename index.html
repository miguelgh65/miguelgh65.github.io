    <h1>Miguel Gonzalez Hernandez</h1>
    <p>Telecommunications Engineer and consultant for Sortis. Working on a dedicated international project for ST Engineering Idirect as an Application Engineer. In my role, I handle support for satellite networks, from the installation of hubs on the Dialog platform to Python scripting. My passion is data science and data analysis, which has allowed me to acquire roles within the team, developing algorithms to enhance team efficiency using Salesforce analytics, artificial intelligence, and regression algorithms like Lasso or Ridge for time series forecasting with deep learning.</p>
